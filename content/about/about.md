Farzad Golghasemi (b. 1988 Urmia) is a transdisciplinary artist and researcher who focuses on architecture and spatial production through the agency of software and technology. By incorporating speculation, programming, and 3D modeling, they explore the new modes of world-making through synthetic and temporal aspects of construction.

Farzad studied architecture at Middle East Technical University (2014) and acquired a Digital Media master’s degree from the University of the Arts Bremen (2023). As a member of the *nota* association, they offered workshops and talks on coding at 36. Stuttgarter Filmwinter festival, Kampnage in Hamburg, Tatwerk in Berlin. Together with Gabriela Valdespino, their performance *Endless Twist* premiered at Schwankhalle Bremen in March 2023. In 2022 as a part of hacer sitio collective, they initiated the project *RESTORE_* a series of performances through temporary occupations of empty stores in Bremen. Farzad is actively involved in the independent art and cultural scene, supporting self-organized spaces and co-initiating projects like SUDORAع, a Bremen-based collective that investigates collaborative practices around sonic expression.
