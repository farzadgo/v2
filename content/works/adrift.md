***Adrift*** deconstructs Google Maps direction text* and by doing so it offers a new set of directions based on the original one, thus it enables the performers to get lost in their very own environment. "Getting lost" refers to the perception of the urban fabric in a different way than what we usually experience in **everyday life**.

During the walk to nowhere, the performers are being asked a set of questions regarding their surrounding and offered the opportunity to record answers in the form of conversations between them, hoping to initiate another level of observation and meaning-making through the act of walking and mapping.

## Temporal Redirections exhibition

The two channel video installation depicting a *drift* performance using Adrift app in Viertel neighborhood of Bremen.

The exhibition of master's projects by master's students in digital media Bremen. The exhibitions included projects ranging from multimedia installations to performances and video projections. Playing with the term "Temporal Redirections" is a way to summarize, joke, reflect, and exorcise the long gestation of this exhibition, which was actually scheduled for April 2021, in hopes of a good ending.

- `date` August 2021
- `location` Open Space Domshof Bremen
