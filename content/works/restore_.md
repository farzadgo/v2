*RESTORE_* is a series of projects and performances that took place through the temporary occupation of empty stores in the the west side of Bremen. Through [temporal] practices of place-making; 11 artist where selected via open call to investigate human and non-human interaction with sites through employing performance, dance, and bodily practices in conjunction with sound, visuals, technology, and new modes of communication and collaboration. By questioning the materiality of the spaces and the entities filling them, the project considered ways to relocate the theater to vacant stores in neighborhoods outside the Kulturmeile Bremen.

> In the age of excessive information and spaces—and on account of the pandemic—it seems that abandoned local shops are becoming more frequent. Are they “local” places as before or in the process of becoming non-places? It is hard to answer this question due to their local yet uninhabited qualities. In contrast to localities that come to existence because of being historical and intimately connected to both social and individual identities, non-places are spaces where residues from human practices do not accumulate. Do spaces devoid of habitation by entities become nonsensical spaces of excess or waste? What is their function in the absence of people? Or, is emptiness only so because it is characterized via the absence of physical bodies and humans? Do entities such as sound, radio waves, and wireless data fill them?
