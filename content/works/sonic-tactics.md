# Sonic Tactics

- 2-day program, live performances, readings, collective listening sessions, audiovisual performances and screenings
- September 2024

Sonic Tactics was a two-day event as part of the GB Open Days 2024 in Güterbahnhof
Bremen-Areal für Kunst. It was an experiment about sharing, where sound becomes a way of
being, a practice of gathering. The event gathered artists and performers who explored the
tactical use of sonic expression. Through different forms we engaged on theoretical
discussions with an oxelized reading, we active listened to field recordings, speculative
narratives, and engaged with live sonic experimentation.
