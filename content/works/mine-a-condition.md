The project MIME: A condition has been a journey of exploration, observation, and artistic research. It delves into the transformations occurring within our cities, shedding light on how they reshape our perspectives and leave behind remnants of the past. We have placed a focus on the shifts in economic and developmental priorities and how these changes impact individuals, communities, and local businesses.

Through workshops, walks, reading sessions, film screenings, and discussions, our research has encompassed a range of entangled subjects. Weâ€˜ve delved into the historical aspect of the space, the materiality of the built environment, critically examined the process of thinking through building and constructing softwares, explored the politics of the space, immersed ourselves in the sonic environment around the UMZU pavilion, contemplated the role of AI in shaping and reshaping artistic practice and organizing, and ventured into tracing the horizonless realm.
