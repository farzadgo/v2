The two channel video installation depicting a *drift* performance using Adrift app in Viertel neighborhood of Bremen.

The exhibition of master's projects by master's students in digital media Bremen. The exhibitions included projects ranging from multimedia installations to performances and video projections. Playing with the term "Temporal Redirections" is a way to summarize, joke, reflect, and exorcise the long gestation of this exhibition, which was actually scheduled for April 2021, in hopes of a good ending.
