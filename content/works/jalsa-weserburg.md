JALSA (Presented by SUDORAع) is conceived as a durational format for collective inquiry, grounded in a posture of attentiveness.

These gatherings are framed as open encounters for improvisation, experimentation, and interdisciplinary dialogue. JALSA explores how different media, sonic, visual, spatial (and beyond) can enter into conversation and serve as a speculative site for rethinking the conditions and potentials of collaboration across disciplines and discursive frameworks.

This JALSA was developed in response to Abd Tammaa’s ongoing research project *Marks on the Ground, Hands in the Air*. The project deals with the Peace Palace in The Hague, with particular attention to the courtroom of the International Court of Justice and the painting *La Paix et la Justice* that hangs its there.

Farzad, Gabriela, and Abd brought their practices into dialogue through an audiovisual performance featuring live sound improvisation alongside real-time 3D modeling. Together, they enacted cycles of construction and deconstruction, as response to each other’s impulses.
