As SUDORAع we have been working on this format since Sonic Tactics 2024 and this year was nice to have been able
to try it again in a more performative setting. ***Turvis: Fragmented Readings on CollaborativeTactics*** is an
ever-changing way of structuring an encounter through mutual listening. It is a role-based reading practice
that situates our work within broader disciplines. We approached a collection of text fragments by adopting
different modes of attention, specific moves/roles and distributing speaking time to generate a dynamic diversity
of perspectives.
