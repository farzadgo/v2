# SUDORA3 presents: turvis

turvis refers to an always changing way of structuring an encounter of mutual listening.

SUDORA3 invites participants to a role-based lecture performance that situates their practice within broader disciplines. The format is based on the oxels framework developed by [XORG](https://xorg.how/), which draws from organizational theory and game design to facilitate experimental approaches to collective structuring through action.

In this lecture performance, SUDORA3 draws from their practice in the fields of sound, music, and aesthetics, grounded in the belief that knowledge is abundant within communities and flourishes through exchange. Participants engage with a selection of text excerpts through a rotating set of roles. With each new paragraph, participants adopt a different mode of attention, producing a dynamic of diversity of perspectives and redistribution of time.

The reading will conclude with a discussion, accompanied by food prepared with Schwankhalle’s mobile kitchen.
