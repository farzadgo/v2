*Push/Pull* situates itself in a reconstructed 3D environment to address the algorithmic regimes shaping architectural thinking and production. It examines how modeling software, presented as “intuitive”, consolidates a dualism between world and world-maker, an apparatus that positions the architect as both subject and product of a contagious reductivism. This is the terrain of *SketchUp architecture:* not merely a formal tendency, but a mode of spatial production structured by patent economy, algorithmic dependency, and techno-economic dominance.

### About the exhibition

*From partial fractures, may they heal anew* considers fragmentation, interruption, and decay as possibilities for a plot twist. It seeks to disrupt stagnant narratives. Historical continuity is averted through a building process that potentiates architectures infinitely open to benevolent transformations.

Through video essays, installations, and sculptures, fragments of the existing are recomposed into the outline of an elsewhere. A contemplation that situates coexistence and reconfiguration as grounds for fragile encounters that allow for longing.
