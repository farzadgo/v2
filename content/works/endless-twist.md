**Endless Twist: *A critical autoethnographic approach to the current state of urban development*** is a guided walk through a 3D space that is constructed by urban fragments and personal memories. It is multimedia web installation and audiovisual performance presenting the artist's critical perspective regarding the agency of the human and non-human, and by extension of architects, planners, and owners. While reflecting on the role of architecture as an apparatus that produces power dynamics, Farzad Golghasemi examines the corporeality associated with physical and digital spaces, through a techno-poetical interpretation of the contemporary state of political economy.
