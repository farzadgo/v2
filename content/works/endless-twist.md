# ENDLESS TWIST

- Interactive mixed-media WebGL website (2023)
- Concept, script, web and 3D development: Farzad Golghasemi
- Sound, dramaturgy: [Gabriela Valdespino](https://gvaldespino.xyz)
- Partially developed during *Tender Absence* 2023 online residency

*Endless Twist* is a guided walk through a 3D space that is constructed by urban fragments and personal memories. It is a multimedia web installation and audiovisual performance presenting the artist's critical perspective regarding the agency of the human and non-human, and by extension of architects, planners, and owners. While reflecting on the role of architecture as an apparatus that produces power dynamics, Farzad Golghasemi examines the corporeality associated with physical and digital spaces, through a techno-poetical interpretation of the contemporary state of political economy.

The installation at the 2023 HfK Bremen Graduate Show ([Jahresausstellung](https://instagram.com/jahresausstellung_hfk)) consisted of collected construction site artifacts assembled to function as a screen for the projection of the Endless Twist mixed-media webpage. The visitors were invited to use a wireless mouse to look around the virtual environment of the web page which is a reconstruction of the urban area where the newly built exhibition building exists which is a reflection on the storyline that involves the author's past experiences associated with urban renewal narratives.

Farzad Golghasemi received [special commendation](https://www.hfk-bremen.de/en/news/frese-design-preise-2023/1014) (besondere belobigungen) from the jury members of Frese-Design-Award which was composed of Marie du Chastel, Simon Busse, and Serge Rompza.
