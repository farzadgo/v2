Technical assistant and 3D development in collaboration with artists Mona Mahall and Asli Serbest for their work *Digital Twin*. The virtual space was exhibited at *STUDIO BOSPORUS – Festival 10 Jahre Kulturakademie Tarabya* at Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien Berlin.

"As the pandemic evolves, the interactive, online-accessible model of the embassy resi- dence in Tarabya reacts to the situation in isolation and seeks a virtual way out. Transported to Bethanien, it becomes a phantom double that, mirror-like, reformulates the space under a post-colonial aspect and opens it up for interventions by artists living in Turkey."

— *Mona Mahall and Asli Serbest*
