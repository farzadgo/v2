# Listen to my postcard

- Digital photography, literary text, digital sound

- Residency and online exhibit: [COAPPARATION](https://thealit.de/en/lab_coapparation) by Thealit F.K.L.
- March – April 2021

> Sound is everywhere, that it is like air, but rather that it is more diffuse, and deeper impact, that air has a sound, and the sound is alive to die, never-ending, that the sound never silences. Over the years, the relationship and analogy between music/sound art/sound design and architecture have been explored in several aspects. In the same way, architecture works over the solid materials, visual spaces, geometry, abstract realities, or social contexts, it does over the aural realities, the sonic dimension. When it comes to space, sound can be valued in an architectural process, just as architecture is also sonic.
