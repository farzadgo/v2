By performing the practice of space [re]production (digital and physical) based on the activities between the author's own bodily experiences and his living room— **Co-Created Pavilion** aims to recapture the idea that our environments we live in are in fact getting reproduced and co-created based on our interactions with them.

While the existing space is represented by an enclosing cube, the bodily experience generates corresponding form. The co-created space is the void as the result of subtraction of either forms.
