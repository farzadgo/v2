# Co-created Pavilion

- Rectangular wood strips, steel bolts and nuts
- Exhibition: Hochschultage 2020 of University of the Arts Bremen
- February 2020

The pavilion installation explores the idea that the environments we live in are continuously reproduced and co-created through our interactions with them. This concept is expressed by performing the practice of space [re]production—both digital and physical—based on the relationship between the author's bodily experiences and their living room. While the existing space is represented by an enclosing cube, the bodily experience generates a corresponding form. The co-created space emerges as the void resulting from the subtraction of either form.
